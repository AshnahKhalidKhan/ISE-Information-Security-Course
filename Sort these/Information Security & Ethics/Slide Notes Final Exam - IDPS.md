# Evasion
- ability of an attacker to bypass or evade IDPS
## Fragmentation:
-  breaking up an attack into smaller packets
## Traffic Obfuscation:
- encryption, tunneling, or packet encoding to disguise their network traffic
## Protocol manipulation:
- modify network protocols, such as TCP or DNS
## Polymorphic attacks:
- modifying attack code/payload to create unique variations that can bypass signature-based detection methods
## Timing-based attacks:
-  launch attacks at specific times or in specific patterns

# IDPS Confidence Value assigning techniques:
## Signature-based detection:
- compare network traffic against known threat signatures
- degree of similarity based confidence values
## Behavior-based detection:
- analyze network and system behavior
- level of deviation from normal behavior based confidence values
## Correlation-based detection:
- identify patterns of behavior that indicate a potential security threat
- strength of the correlation based confidence values

# False attack stimulus
- simulated security threat used to test effeectiveness of IDPS
## Honeypot
- decoy systems designed to lure potential attackers away from critical systems
- collect information about attackerâ€™s activity
- encourage attacker to stay on system until the event is documented and responded to
## Honeynet
- collection of honeypots
## Padded cell systems
- protected honeypot that cannot be easily compromised
- when IDPS detects attackers, padded cell system transfers them to special simulated environment where they can cause no harm

# Network-based IDPS (NIDPS):
- set on each network entry/exit point
- looks for attack patterns in network traffic
## Placement:
- behind external firewall
- in front of external firewall
- on major network
- on critical subnet
# Wireless IDPS:
- monitors and analyzes wireless network traffic
# Network behavior analysis IDPS
- detects DoS attacks, scanning, worms, policy violations
- packet-sniffing
#  Host-based IDPS (HIDPS):
- set on each host
- monitors the status and modification of key system files

# IDPS Detection Methods
## Signature-based:
- looks for patterns in network traffic that match known attacker signatures
- new attack patterns must regualrly be added to IDPS signature database
## Anomaly-based:
- looks for activity is outside baseline parameters or clipping level
- may generate false positives
## Stateful protocol analysis:
- comparing known normal/benign protocol profiles against observed traffic
- deep packet inspection
## Log file monitors:
- Reviews log files generated by servers, network devices and other IDPSs to look for pattern and signatures

# Implementations of IDPS:
## Centralized
## Fully-distributed
## Partially-distributed

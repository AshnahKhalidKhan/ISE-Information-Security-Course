## Surface Web:
- 4% of web

## Deep Web:
- 92% of web
- password-protected + search-protected
- Netflix, medical/financial/legal/scientific reports and records and documents

## Dark web/Darknet:
- 4% of web
- decntralized network of private, encrypted websites
- not accessible through traditional search engines or web browsers
- onion sites, drugs/firearms trafficiking, ploticial protests, Ross Ulbricht's Silk Road
- established when onion routing began
- original intent: share information freely
- Accessible by VMs, VPNs, Linux distributions to access Darkweb
- used for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI):
- collection and analysis of information about threats and adversaries 
- drawing patterns to make knowledgeable decisions 
- for the preparedness, prevention and response actions against various cyber attacks

## VMs:
- allows multiple OS to run simultaneously
- used when you want ISOLATION
### Uses:
- testing of software
- attack simulations

## VPNs:
- provide secure, encrypted connection (tunnel)
- masking gives you anonymity
- masks IP + encryption

## Proxy:
- only masks IP + NO encryption

## Linux distributions to access Darkweb:
### The Onion Router/Tor:
- onion routing to create a network of private and anonymous websites that are accessible
- pass traffic through series of network nodes, performing encryption at each until destination reached
- Entry node – introduce your data into Tor Circuit.
- Middle nodes – decryption is done at each layer.
- Exit node – decrypted data leaves the Tor network. 
#### Benefits:
- free
#### Weaknesses:
- Tracking done at the entry and exit nodes
### I2P:
- The Invisible Internet Project
- Provide end-to-end encryption
- Encryption done in 4 layers
### Freenet:
- Dark Refuge for Freedom of Speech
- Uses decentralized distributed  networks for encryption
### Whonix:
- Hide IP + Identity
- No logging
### Tails:
- OS made specifically for Darkweb

## Anonymity:
- conceal identity
### Methods:
- hide IP and web traffic
- pass through several routers/nodes
- use encryption

## Anonymizer:
- anonymous proxy which allows the user to browse Internet anonymously. 
### Examples:
- VPNs kay naam

## Darkweb tools:
- Daniel: tells if dark website is online
- Facebook Onion site: allows you to access Facebook in restricted countries
- Torch, DuckDuckGo: search engines for darkweb
- Securedrop: whistleblower for freedom of speech

## Protocols for inter-element communication in Digital Twins:
- DT Definition Language (DTDL)
- FIWARE
- Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA)
- Feature-Based DT Framework (FDTF)
- Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
- Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

- Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) 

# Digital Twin:
- a computational model that represents a unique instance of a physical system
- a complete model that captures and maintains digital information throughout the product/system lifecycle, from design and manufacturing to operation and maintenance. 
## Modules:
### Physical:
- components doing data collection from physical systems
### Digital:
- computer models capable of processing such information and optimizing decision-making 
## Components:
### Digital shadow:
-  physical systems and their respective data collected to create a shadow of the physical environment
### Digital master:
- composed of computer models capable of capturing the digital shadow and mirroring the behavior of physical systems to assist decision
## Benefits:
- test products before they are built
- simulate in different scenarios and identify any problems early during design
- reduce risk of product failure
- improve cost-efficency and cost-effectiveness of business by monitoring and managing product in real-time to ensure smooth running
- provide digital replica of product for customers to better understand how it works --> leads to better customer satisfaction and loyalty
## Uses:
- simulation, analysis, control, decision-making
- Spacecraft + aircraft
- detect defective products before they are finished, by creating digital factories
- digital twin car for autonomous driving


# Digital Twin categories:
## Design prototype-based categories:
### Virtual twins:
- created through simulations and modeling
- represent product, system or process in digital environment
### Physical twins:
- created by embedding sensors and data collection mechanisms in physical objects
- enable the monitoring and analysis of their performance in real-time.
## Function-based categories:
### Design-related twins:
- used in intial design process stages
- used to simulate and optimize the performance of a product or system before it is built. 
### Production-related twins:
- used to monitor and optimize the production process
### Operation-related twins:
-  used to monitor and optimize the performance of a product/system in real-time during its operational 
phase
## Type-based categories:
### Component twins:
- models of individual parts (motors, switches, sensors etc)
- provide info on performance and behavior in real-time and over time
- help check health and performance of these components
### Asset twins:
- models of physical assets (buildings, machines, vehicles etc)
- provide info on asset's operational status, performance, and environmental conditions in real time
- help reduce downtime and increase operational efficiency
### System twins:
- models of entire systems or processes
- monitor and analyze system performance and idetify improvement areas
- help optimize and improve operations
### Process twins:
- models of business processes or customer journeys
- provide info on customer interactions with products/services in real-time
- help identify customer experience improvment areas
